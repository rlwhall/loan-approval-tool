# Loan Approval Tool

## Goal 
<br/>

We want to automate the loan eligibility process based on customer details that are provided through online application forms. You can find the dataset [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h_jl9xqqqHflI5PsuiQd_soNYxzFfjKw/view?usp=sharing). These details include factors such as the customer's Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, and Credit History.

<br>

### Approach

The problem was explored in the following steps: 
1. Hypothesis Generation – understanding the problem better by brainstorming possible factors that can impact the outcome
2. Data Exploration – looking at categorical and continuous feature summaries and making inferences about the data.
3. Data Cleaning – imputing missing values in the data and checking for outliers
4. Feature Engineering – modifying existing variables and creating new ones for analysis
5. Model Building – making predictive models on the data
6. Deployment - building a Flask API, and deploying both localling and to the Cloud (AWS)
<br />
